	<h2>Slides.js in a nutshell…</h2>

	<h2>Main features</h2>
	Slides.js is packed with features:
	<ul>
		<li>The slides are automatically resized to adapt to the screen size.</li>
		<li>By typing on the "O" key, you can get an overwiew of all slides and easily move between them.</li>
		<li>Presenter notes are available and synchronized with the slideshow status, this document is an example.</li>
		<li>People in the audience can get the slideshow on their own device and view it automatically synchronized with the talk.</li>
		<li>Transitions between slides are animated and configurable.</li>
		<li>Inside each slide, you can have several fragments which are animated individually.</li>
		<li>The whole slideshow may be configured with CSS only.</li>
